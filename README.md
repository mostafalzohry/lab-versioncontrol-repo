# Answer of the questions

1 - pull request

for pull request , i understand the concept , in pull request , u can leave comment for the author of the code , maybe this comment to advise him to remove something or add something , and in pull request too , u can merge between branches

2 - git reset

if i have 5 commits , and then i found that the last two commits are bad and i wanna back to my number 3 commit , and i wanna number 3 commit to be my head , so i will use git reset , but the disadvanage of that i will lose number 4 and 5 comiitts


3 - git revert
This is a safe way to undo changes, as it has no chance of re-writing the commit history, The use of git revert is to create a new commit which reverts a previous commit, The HEAD will point to the new reverting commit. 


 4 - git restore
git restore is to restore the things happened in the working tree so restore files not restore branch
